= Tutorial
:toc:

In this tutorial, you will add trace telemetry to a Clojure program and view the traces in https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger], a telemetry backend.
You will use spans and traces to describe the runtime behaviour of your program.
You will enrich the spans with attributes and events, and see how runtime exceptions are presented.
Finally, you'll change from Jaeger to https://zipkin.io/[Zipkin], without needing to change any code.
