All `clj-otel-*` module versions are released in lockstep to Clojars.

`x.y.z` versions listed below do not follow semantic versioning.
Instead, development proceeds on a linear path where `z` increases for batches of incremental changes and `y` increases (with `z` reset to `0`) when milestones are reached.

Breaking changes will be documented here.

WARNING: Until version `1.0.0` there is a greater possibility of breaking changes.
